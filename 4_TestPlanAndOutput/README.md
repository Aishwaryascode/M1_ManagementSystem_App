# Test Plan
* For every feature, define a test case
    - How to run that feature
    - Define expected behaviour
    - Capture the actual result
- Test Cases are good in revealing the presence of faults. Successful in implementation of test cases implies that there are no error in program. Test cases should be minimum as they are expensive in case of money & efforts. Primary objectives of test cases are to ensure that if there is an error or fault in program it is exercise by the test cases. An ideal test case set is one that succeeds only if there are no errors in the program. One possible ideal set of test case is one that includes all possible I/P to the program and is called exhaustive testing. A test case is good if it detect in undiscovered error in program.
